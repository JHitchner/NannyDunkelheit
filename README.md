#### A story of friendship, adventure and nothing creepy at all.

<ul><strong> About this project:</strong><ul>
Nanny Dunkelheit was created with vanilla javascript, CSS3, HTML5. I used Sinatra as the MVC for the purpose of implementing the Sendgrid API.
The images were created in Photoshop CS5 and the audio was edited with Reason and Audacity. The individual audio pieces are public domain and were 
sampled from freesound.org.
