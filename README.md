### About this project:
Nanny Dunkelheit is an interactive storytelling experience inspired by a game I am currently developing in Unity. The user can click on certain elements of the page to trigger audio and animations.
### Tech Used in Development
Nanny Dunkelheit was created in vanilla JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5. It was built in Sinatra for the purpose of implementing the Sendgrid API.
The images were created in Photoshop CS5 and the audio was edited with Reason and Audacity. The individual audio pieces are public domain and were sampled from freesound.org.
